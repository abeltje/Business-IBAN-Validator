Business-IBAN-Validator

This module provides a validator for IBANs (International Bank Account Numbers)
(ISO 13616).

The validation consists of a number of tests:

- Know country code (ISO 3166 alpha2)
- Correct length (different for each country)
- Correct pattern (different for each country)
- Correct 97-checksum

On top of that, the validator also knows which countries participate in SEPA
(Single Euro Payment Area).

The "Database" with this information is based on a document published by
SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) in January
2015 (IBAN Registry Release 54).
